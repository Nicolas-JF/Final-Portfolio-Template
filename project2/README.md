## Project #2: Full Stack Inventory Management System

A full-stack inventory management app that enables users to track, edit, and organize product inventories, with built-in authentication for user roles.  

- **Users**: Small businesses, warehouse managers, admin staff  
- **What job does it perform?** Allows them to easily manage product stocks, preventing inventory shortages or oversupply  
- **What inspired you to make it?** I wanted to learn full CRUD operations plus secure role-based authentication in a practical setting.  
- **Most important features**: CRUD product records, JWT authentication, role-based controls, responsive interface  
- **Screenshots**: (Add screenshots here later using `![alt text](image_url)`)

## Competencies

### JF 1.4 Agile Development and Communication  
**“Works effectively as a member of an agile team, communicating clearly with others.”**  
- I contributed to GitHub project boards, documented features, and engaged in pair-programming with teammates.  
- I helped break user stories into tasks and assigned issues for the team.  
- This improved the team’s focus and velocity during the sprints.  
- In this project, that competency showed up by maintaining team communication and progress visibility on inventory features.

### JF 2.4 Simple Software Design  
**“Uses simple software design to produce clear, maintainable code.”**  
- I separated concerns between React UI, Express routes, and SQLite models.  
- I adopted modular React components and a consistent REST API structure.  
- This simplified onboarding for future team members.  
- This competency is demonstrated through creating a logical, easy-to-maintain code structure in the inventory project.

### JF 6.5 Independent Work  
**“Manages own tasks independently, demonstrating persistence and reliability.”**  
- I researched best practices for JWT auth and implemented secure middleware on my own.  
- I tested user role permissions in detail, fixing corner cases in the authentication logic.  
- These actions built my confidence in securing user data.  
- This project proved I can independently handle complex, security-related logic.
