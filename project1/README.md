## Project #1: Weather App

A full-stack weather application enabling users to search for and view real-time weather conditions worldwide.  

- **Users**: General public, travelers, weather enthusiasts  
- **What job does it perform?** It provides convenient, accurate weather forecasts to help users plan their activities.  
- **What inspired you to make it?** I wanted to build a practical, full-stack app that consumes third-party APIs and displays dynamic data in real time.  
- **Most important features**: City-based search, current conditions, responsive UI, reliable error handling  
- **Screenshots**: (Add screenshots in this section later using `![alt text](image_url)`)

## Competencies

### JF 1.3 Roles and Responsibilities  
**“Takes responsibility for own work, plans tasks, and manages quality, seeking guidance where needed.”**  
- I led the entire build of the frontend React components while also developing the Express API routes.  
- I broke down tasks into small features, wrote a plan, and regularly committed with disciplined version control.  
- This resulted in a fully functional weather search and display feature, improving my confidence in owning a project end-to-end.  
- This competency was applied by planning and implementing a weather search interface and connecting it to a Node/Express backend.

### JF 2.3 User Interface Development  
**“Develops simple, responsive, and accessible user interfaces based on user requirements.”**  
- I designed a simple search bar with clearly presented weather results and responsive layouts.  
- By applying best practices in React and CSS, I delivered a clean interface that worked smoothly on all screen sizes.  
- As a result, the project was intuitive and easy to use, even for nontechnical users.  
- This directly aligned with creating the weather app UI to make weather lookup fast and accessible.

### JF 5.1 Curiosity and Creativity  
**“Demonstrates curiosity about technology and applies creative approaches to problem solving.”**  
- I experimented with multiple weather APIs, explored asynchronous data handling, and refined the data display logic.  
- I iterated on styling and user feedback while investigating how to handle errors creatively.  
- These steps strengthened my skills in debugging and UI resilience.  
- This competency is shown through experimenting with external APIs and optimizing the user experience in this project.
